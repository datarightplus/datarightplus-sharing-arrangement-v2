                   DataRight+: Sharing Arrangement V2
       draft-authors-datarightplus-sharing-arrangement-v2-latest

Abstract

   This specification outlines the technical requirements related to the
   delivery of an enhanced establishment process for data sharing
   arrangements under DataRight+ and the Consumer Data Right.

   Sharing Arrangement V2 is intended to be the next evolution of
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-SHARING-ARRANGEMENT-V1-00] and incorporates modern and
   international standards aligned practices to achieve like for like
   outcomes.  This specification takes significant inspiration from the
   [FAPI-GRANT-MANAGEMENT] specification and the original intent based
   pattern first presented within the UK Open Banking scheme.

1.  Scope

   The scope of this specification is focused on describing the
   authorisation related components of establishing an authentication
   and authorisation context for data sharing under the DataRight+
   framework.  This specification achieves the same objectives as those
   prescribed within [CDS] but avoids the ecosystem specific components
   in favour of a more extensible and international standards aligned
   mechanisms.

2.  Terms & Definitions

   This specification uses the terms "Agreement Identifier", Consumer",
   "Provider", "Initiator", "Personally Identifiable Information (PII)",
   "Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID)", "Initiator", "CDR Sharing
   Arrangement" and "CDR Sharing Agreement Identifier" as defined by
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-ROSETTA].

3.  High Level Process

   This document, as extended further in OpenAPI format within
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-REDOCLY], describes the endpoints to deliver the
   Sharing Arrangement V2 capability.  The current approach to data
   sharing within the Consumer Data Right is brittle and does not
   provide sufficient feedback as to the status of sharing requests as
   they are handed over from Initiator to the Provider.  The existing
   sharing establishment process also assumes a live establishment
   rather than a potentially asynchronous, back-channel or machine to
   machine (IoT) authorisation approach.

   At a high level the process expected to be followed through the
   implementation of this specification is:

   1.  Initiator utilises a client credentials grant to obtain a token
       from the Provider;
   2.  Initiator calls the Request Sharing Agreement endpoint and
       obtains an actionId in the initial status of PENDING;
   3.  Initiator submits a pushed authorisation request with a Request
       Object containing the urn:dio:action_id parameter with a value
       equal to the actionId returned in (2)
   4.  Initiator redirects the Consumer user-agent to complete the
       authorisation process
   5.  On completion of the authorisation process:
       1.  the Provider, if not already assigned, assigns an agreementId
           to the associated actionId
       2.  the Initiator performs authorization_code token exchange to
           access the Provider Resource Server resources

   _Note:_ At any time before, during or after the authorisation process
   the Initiator can use the Get Sharing Agreement endpoint provided by
   the Resource Server utilising the obtained actionId.

4.  Provider

   The following provisions apply to services delivered by Providers.

4.1.  Authorisation Server

   In addition to the provisions outlined in
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-INFOSEC-BASELINE] the authorisation server:

   1.  SHALL support the dio:sharing authorisation scope;
   2.  SHALL include the dio:sharing authorisation scope within Dynamic
       Client Registration responses;

4.1.1.  Request Object

   The request object submitted to the authorisation server:

   1.  SHALL support an optional string parameter urn:dio:action_id
       referencing a valid [Action Identifier];
   2.  SHALL reject requests containing a urn:dio:action_id parameter
       that is unknown, expired or not associated with the requesting
       Initiator;

4.1.1.1.  Example

   The following is a non-normative example of a decoded request object
   requesting authorisation for a previously lodged actionId

   {
     "iss": "33ff17d6-d967-4823-a4d3-1206fd2fff3f",
     "exp": 1725090872,

     "aud": "https://www.provider.com.au",
     "response_type": "code",
     "response_mode": "jwt",
     "client_id": "33ff17d6-d967-4823-a4d3-1206fd2fff3f",
     "redirect_uri": "https://www.recipient.com.au/coolstuff",
     "scope": "openid",
     "claims": {

       "id_token": {
         "acr": {
           "essential": true,
           "values": ["urn:cds.au:cdr:3"]
         }
       },
       "userinfo": {
         "given_name": null,
         "family_name": null
       }
     },
     "code_challenge": "rerbvXfTDYNECzwayM8-SLCWU1FDzBnqMCv1RB5AudU",
     "code_challenge_method": "S256"
   }

4.1.2.  Claims

   The authorisation server:

   1.  SHALL include within the Introspection Endpoint response:
       1.  the exp claim, with a value equal to the expiry time of the
           underlying Sharing Agreement and;
       2.  the urn:dio:action_id claim, containing the assigned [Action
           Identifier];

4.1.3.  CDR Arrangement V1 Compatibility

   In order to maximise backward compatibility and facilitate orderly
   transition for endpoints already implemented the Authorisation Server
   SHALL ensure that the following authorisation scopes are mapped to
   Data Cluster values which are successfully authorised:

                                  Table 1

4.2.  Resource Server

   The Provider Resource Server: 1.  SHALL support the
   requestDataSharingAgreement and getDataSharingAgreement endpoints as
   described in [DATARIGHTPLUS-REDOCLY]; 2.  SHALL support
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-DISCOVERY-V1-01] and advertise the
   requestDataSharingAgreement and getDataSharingAgreement endpoints 3.
   SHALL support providing an existing agreementId in order to extend an
   existing agreement in subsequent Request Sharing Agreement requests
   4.  MAY support Consumer Type (consumerType) authorisation filtering
   and, if supported, include the SUPPORTS_CONSUMER_TYPE flag at the
   requestDataSharingAgreement endpoint 5.  MAY support record filtering
   by date (oldestDate/newestDate) and, if supported, include the
   SUPPORTS_DATE_FILTER flag at the requestDataSharingAgreement endpoint

5.  Initiator

   The following provisions apply to participants operating Initiators.

5.1.  Authorisation Client

   In addition to the provisions outlined in Section 4 of
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-INFOSEC-BASELINE] the Initiator authorisation client:

   1.  SHALL support the Initiator provisions of
       [DATARIGHTPLUS-DISCOVERY-V1-01] to discover the
       getDataSharingAgreement and requestDataSharingAgreement
       endpoints;
   2.  SHALL perform a Dynamic Client Registration update, as described
       in [DATARIGHTPLUS-ADMISSION-CONTROL-00], to be granted access to
       the dio:sharing scope;
   3.  SHALL only include optional Request Sharing Agreement parameters
       if they are advertised within the Provider discovery document

6.  Implementation Considerations

   This specification does not explicitly state how long an assigned
   Action Identifier persists for however it is expected that an
   Initiator shall be able to reference an Action Identifier while the
   associated authorisation is still active and for a significant period
   (more than a year) after it becomes inactive.

7.  Security Considerations

   The Action Identifier SHALL NOT be guessable, derivable nor identify
   the Consumer.
